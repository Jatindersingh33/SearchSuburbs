# SearchSuburbs
A very basic application that will use REST API. It needs to have a text field, button for searching and display the found suburb on the map below. It needs to be responsive.

# Run the application using three simple steps
1) npm install
2) npm run dev
3) npm start

# Open browser and query Area, Lat, Lon based on postcode entered

http://localhost:8080/api/areas/{postcode}

eg. http://localhost:8080/api/areas/2000


# Open browser and query

http://localhost:8080

to get the GUI for the above API (http://localhost:8080/api/areas/2000)
