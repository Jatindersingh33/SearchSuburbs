# SearchSuburbs
A very basic application that will use REST API. It needs to have a text field, button for searching and display the found suburb on the map below. It needs to be responsive.

# Run the application using three simple steps
npm install
npm run dev
npm start

Open browser and query Area, Lat, Lon based on postcode entered
http://localhost:8080/api/areas/{postcode}
eg. http://localhost:8080/api/areas/2000

Open browser and query
http://localhost:8080
to get the GUI for the above API (http://localhost:8080/api/areas/2000)
